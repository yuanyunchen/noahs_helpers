PROJECT 4: NOAH’S HELPERS – FULL SPECIFICATION (STRUCTURED)

1. OVERVIEW
Noah must gather one male and one female of each species before the great flood. Multiple helpers explore a large 1000×1000 km landscape, locate animals, shepherd them back to the Ark, and attempt to maximize the score under strict movement, visibility, communication, and timing constraints.

2. MAP AND WORLD
- World size: 1000 km × 1000 km, represented as a 1000 × 1000 grid.
- Ark position: integer cell (XA, YA), with 0 ≤ XA, YA ≤ 999.
- Helpers start at the Ark at continuous position (x, y) = (XA, YA).
- A helper’s cell is (floor(x), floor(y)).

3. HELPERS
3.1 Capabilities
- Can carry (shepherd) up to 4 animals at a time.
- Movement: up to 1 km per turn in any direction, only if the helper did NOT obtain or release an animal during that turn.
- Sight: 5 km radius; can see other helpers and animals.
- Species recognition: from a distance they know the species; gender can be determined only when in the same cell as the animal.
- Obtaining animals: when entering a cell with animals, the helper may choose to pick up any subset.
- Releasing animals: helpers may release animals to free space; released animals remain in the current cell.
- Unloading at Ark: when entering Ark’s cell, the helper automatically unloads all animals.

3.2 Communication
- Helpers and Noah may broadcast exactly 1 byte per turn.
- Any helper within 5 km receives the broadcast.
- Everyone knows the turn number; time-based encoding is possible.

4. NOAH
- Noah is stationary at the Ark.
- Can broadcast 1 byte per turn, same visibility rules as helpers.
- Functions as coordination center via communication.

5. ANIMALS
5.1 Species and Placement
- There are S species.
- Each species i has population ni ≥ 2.
- Exactly ni animals of species i are placed randomly in the world.
- Multiple animals can occupy the same cell.
- Gender assignment: first two animals of each species are guaranteed opposite genders; the remainder are assigned genders randomly (equal probability).
- Noah and helpers know the ni values beforehand, but not positions or genders.

5.2 Animal Movement
- After each helper-turn, every un‑shepherded animal moves with probability 0.5.
- If moving, animal chooses an orthogonal neighbor cell with the fewest animals.
- If multiple cells tie, one is chosen randomly.

6. ARK RULES
- When a helper reaches the Ark’s cell:
  * For each animal carried: if the Ark does NOT have an animal of that species AND gender yet, the animal is added.
  * If a duplicate (species+gender already present), it is discarded permanently.
- Animals on the Ark contribute to the final score.

7. TIMELINE AND TERMINATION
- Each turn ≈ 10 minutes.
- Obtaining/releasing animals occurs at the END of turn and does not consume movement.
- The simulation ends at unknown time T ≥ 2016 turns (at least 14 days).
- At time T − 1008 (one week before end), rain begins.
- Helpers have exactly 1008 turns (7 days) after rain begins to return to the Ark.
- At the final turn, ALL helpers must be on the Ark.

8. SCORING
- 100 points: species with both male and female on the Ark.
- 1 point: species with only one gender on the Ark.

9. TOURNAMENT VARIATION
The simulator will vary:
- Number of helpers h
- Ark location (XA, YA)
- Final time T
- Number of species S
- Species populations ni
This ensures robustness across many scenarios.

10. STRATEGIC CONSIDERATIONS
- Handling many helpers versus few helpers.
- Exploration strategy for covering a very large 1000×1000 region.
- Coordination vs independent action under limited communication (1 byte/turn).
- How to avoid delivering duplicates (wasting capacity).
- Prioritizing rare species (small ni).
- When to release lower-value animals for rarer ones.
- Planning return deadlines given rain at T − 1008.
- Using sight range (5 km) effectively for distributed search.
- Designing communication protocols using restricted 1-byte messages and turn-based encoding.
